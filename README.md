# Description
This project is a computer vision approach to estimating depth maps of images using stereo rectification with heterogenous cameras. Jibo, the robot used during the project, has a pinhole (small lens) and fish-eye (wide lens) cameras. This makes depth estimation particularly tricky. In this project, we perform special camera calibration and rectification techniques to achieve good results.
